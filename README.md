a poker game app: Given various poker hands as arguments, print what type of hand each argument is. I tried to solve this problem using filter and every array functions!

The list of hands in ranking order are as follows:

Royal Flush	🃁🃎🃍🃋🃊	Ten to Ace of the same suit

Straight Flush	🃛🃚🃙🃘🃗	Five consecutive cards of the same suit

Four of a Kind	🃕🃅🂵🂥🃂	Four cards of the same rank

Full House	🂦🂶🃆🃞🂾	Three of a Kind combined with a Pair

Flush	🃋🃉🃈🃄🃃	Five cards of the same suit

Straight	🃊🂩🂸🃇🃖	Five consecutive cards

Three of a Kind	🃝🂭🂽🂹🂢	Three cards of the same rank

Two Pair	🂻🂫🃓🂣🂲	Two separate pairs

Pair	🂪🂺🂨🂷🃔	Two cards of the same rank

High Card	🃎🃍🂧🂤🂳	No other hand applies
